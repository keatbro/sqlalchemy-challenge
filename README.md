# sqlalchemy-challenge

This project includes an exploration of a Python/SQLite Database connection in a Jupyter Notebook. A couple visualizations are included to analyze the data.

Additionally, I create a simple app with Flask (app.py) which allows the users to return jsonified data from the SQLite Database. I started building this app using sessions to query the database, but later explored connecting to the database via Pandas' read_sql functionality, which I found easier in general to manipulate.
